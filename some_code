$SLOT SIGNAL$:I found that when i declare a "private slot" in the header file and not yet call connect func the connction system will promote that a warning 
	  SLOT(somefunc()) SIGNAL(somesignal()) the target must has parentheses; is better to make  parameters the same(i don't concern too much the platform specify implement so ...)

a nice design you can also use disconnect func to break the connect

#svn,cleanup,checkout update interrput,cleanup fail#
find the particular .svn delete the lock log ,and the file in the dir prop-base but not the dir.
but i don't know whether it will del the log or not.

HEADERS - A list of all the header files for the application.
SOURCES - A list of all the source files for the application.
FORMS - A list of all the UI files (created using Qt Designer) for the application.
LEXSOURCES - A list of all the lex source files for the application.
YACCSOURCES - A list of all the yacc source files for the application.
TARGET - Name of the executable for the application. This defaults to the name of the project file. (The extension, if any, is added automatically).
DESTDIR - The directory in which the target executable is placed.
DEFINES - A list of any additional pre-processor defines needed for the application.
INCLUDEPATH - A list of any additional include paths needed for the application.
DEPENDPATH - The dependency search path for the application.
VPATH - The search path to find supplied files.
DEF_FILE - Windows only: A .def file to be linked against for the application.

#qmake, make, framework include, framework, link framework not found#
framework is a BSD code library format, can be use in many compiler.
include the header file like this
;;;;
//#include <XXXXX(framework's name)/XXXXX(framework's header file, generally it's name.h)
#include <Foundation/Foundation.h>
;;;;
specify the library search path 

#c++, inherition inherit derivation derive, virtual#
$virtual derivation$

case 1:  E         E    case 2:       E 
     	 \        /                  / \
          B      C                  B   C

	      A                       A

case 2 is virtual derivation
your can call the E's func in A 
in case 1 your should call E's func by : a.B::efunc();
